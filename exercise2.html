            <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence
            demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural 
            intelligence displayed by animals including humans. 
            Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents":
            any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that 
            maximize its chance of achieving its goals. 
            Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" 
            to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans
            associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving", 
            however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.

            </p>

            <p>
                AI applications include advanced web search engines 
                (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), 
                understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), 
                self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making 
                and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems 
                (such as chess and Go). As machines become 
                increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" 
                are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the 
                AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently 
                excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine 
                technology.

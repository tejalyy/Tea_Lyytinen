            <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence
            demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural 
            intelligence displayed by animals including humans. 
            Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents":
            any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that 
            maximize its chance of achieving its goals. 
            Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" 
            to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans
            associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving", 
            however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.

            </p>

            <p>
                AI applications include advanced web search engines 
                (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), 
                understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), 
                self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making 
                and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems 
                (such as chess and Go). As machines become 
                increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" 
                are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the 
                AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently 
                excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine 
                technology.

                Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, 
                and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, 
                followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),
                followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. 
                AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, 
                including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large 
                databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 
                21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the 
                field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many 
                challenging problems throughout industry and academia
            </p>
            <p>
                The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the 
                use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, 
                knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, 
                and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to 
                solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these 
                problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving 
                techniques—including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial 
                neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also 
                draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely 
                described that a machine can be made to simulate it". This raises philosophical 
                arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with 
                human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy 
                since antiquity. Science fiction and futurology have also suggested that, with its 
                enormous potential and power, AI may become an existential risk to humanity.
